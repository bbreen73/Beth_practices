# Beth's Practice

## Look what I can do!

I can be **bold**

or *slanted* 

### I can even add fancy things

like 

* an image 

![puppy](/puppy.jpg)

* a link

[lots of dogs](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/pets/g4531/cutest-dog-breeds/)

* a block of code

```python
print("dogs are cute")
```
